My SysAdmin Portfolio & Intune Lab Hub 🚀
This repository contains my professional portfolio website and a series of technical lab reports documenting my journey into Cloud Engineering and System Administration.

🛠️ Project Overview
This project is built using a modern tech stack to showcase both my development and infrastructure skills:

Frontend: Next.js (TypeScript) & Tailwind CSS.

Deployment: Vercel for continuous integration and hosting.

Technical Content: Real-world documentation of Microsoft Intune, VMware, and BIOS troubleshooting.

📚 Featured Lab: Microsoft Intune Setup
I documented a full end-to-end setup of a Windows 11 Virtual Machine managed by Microsoft Intune.

Technical Challenges Solved:
Hardware Virtualization: Resolved the "Intel VT-x is disabled" error by reconfiguring BIOS settings to allow VMware to execute the 64-bit guest OS.

OOBE Enrollment: Fixed the "OOBEKEYBOARD" loop during Windows setup using the oobe\bypassnro command in the Shift+F10 console.

Policy Management: Successfully synced the device to pull security updates and management profiles from the Intune portal.
